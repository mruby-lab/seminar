# RBoard and Development site

## mruby/c and RBoard

**mruby/c** is a programming and executing environment for small devices, it's focused on small memory footprint and low power consumption.

**RBoard** is a microcontroller board for mruby/c. The microcontroller on the RBoard contains the mruby/c VM (Virtual Machine) which executes mruby programs.

With RBoard, you just connect cables between RBoard and your laptop. Then you can implement your code on a web site and transfer your program directly to RBoard.
